%description
The operator is a lightweight, purely reactive obstacle-avoidance module for
mobile robots moving in a planar environment. The operator node works by
evaluating a set of predefined motion primitives based on a local costmap and a
desired direction. The best evaluated motion command will be send to the mobile
base.
